# Code:
The code is divided between different classes (Basically frames) and is easy to understand and modify.

# Issues:
It has no issues except the logic behind WPM calculation. That logic shows approximate and not exact result. The logic is defined inside "result()" function in WPM.java class.

# Conclusion:
This program's UI is Amazing and the code is short as well. There are some limitations which are discussed above. You can get the code from here and Jar and Exe file from release section of this repo.

Thanks for reading till end, please consider checking my other repos as well.
